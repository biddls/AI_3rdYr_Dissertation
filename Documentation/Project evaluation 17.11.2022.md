# Project Evaluation

The aim of this document is to evaluate my proposed dissertation project from three angles to ensure that it meets the requirements of it being well suited for me. The three angles are as follows: Risks, weaknesses, and strengths.

## Project outline

The aim of the dissertation is to

## Risks and how they are mitigated

This section details what risks will the undertaking of this project impose such that not mitigating them will meaningfully hamper my ability to either complete the project or get the grade that I am aiming to achieve.

-   Disappearing of the XSAF project and testing server
1.  I would not have as much access to data to build my models from
2.  This would mean that I would no longer have a reliable testing environment
-   Mitigation of the risks
1.  Get access to a series of save files to fully “replay” the server to be used as training data
    1.  Use a scaping bot on other servers and then use that to create a model
2.  Run my own small testing servers to demonstrate the performance of the bot

## Personal Weaknesses

This section details how the project might expose personal weaknesses in either my knowledge and or ability to complete the work.

-   How to interact with the backend for DCS
1.  This is what enables me to “push” routes to the planes for them to avoid any risks
2.  How to extract the relevant data from DCS to then feed into a model
-   Mitigation of Weaknesses
1.  There seems to be sufficient resources on how to manage the pathing of any unit
2.  I can get the relevant scrips to get a “dump” of the game server

## Personal Strengths

This section details how the project will allow me to demonstrate and or exemplify my strengths such that the choosing of this project will demonstrate them to the fullest and maximise my possible grade and the quality of work I produce.

-   Coding ability
    1.  I feel confident in my ability to write the sufficient python code to get all the data that I would need to build a model with
    2.  In terms of the potential need to code in LUA, David is teaching the language currently
